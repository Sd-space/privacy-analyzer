# [GOOD FIRST ISSUE] Design and Create Extension Icons

## 🎯 Description
The extension currently has placeholder icons. We need proper icon designs in three sizes: 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixels.

## ✨ Expected Outcome
Professional, recognizable icons that represent privacy and security. Icons should:
- Work well at all three sizes
- Be clear and simple
- Use a consistent color scheme
- Relate to privacy/security themes

## 📝 Steps to Complete
1. Design icon concepts (sketches or mockups)
2. Share concepts for feedback
3. Create final icons in PNG format
4. Place them in `extension/icons/` directory
5. Test how they look in the browser extension UI

## 📂 Files to Create
- `extension/icons/icon-16.png` (16x16)
- `extension/icons/icon-48.png` (48x48)
- `extension/icons/icon-128.png` (128x128)

# [GOOD FIRST ISSUE] Improve Extension Popup UI to Show Top 3 Trackers

## 🎯 Description
The extension popup currently shows detected third-party domains, but we want to enhance the UI to:
- Display the **top 3** most common third-party domains prominently
- Add visual indicators (icons, colors) for different types of trackers
- Show a count of total trackers detected

## ✨ Expected Outcome
A more polished and informative popup UI that helps users quickly understand privacy issues on the current page.

## 📝 Steps to Complete
1. Open `extension/popup.js` and `extension/popup.html`
2. Modify the display logic to show only top 3 domains by default
3. Add a "Show all" button to expand the full list
4. Add visual styling (colors, icons) to make it more engaging
5. Test on multiple websites to ensure it works correctly

## 📂 Files to Modify
- `extension/popup.html` - Update the HTML structure
- `extension/popup.js` - Modify the display logic
- Consider adding a `extension/popup.css` file for styling

# [GOOD FIRST ISSUE] Add JSON Export Functionality to Extension

## üéØ Description
Currently, the extension has a button to export JSON reports, but the functionality needs to be fully implemented. We need to ensure the export includes all relevant data and is formatted properly.

## ‚ú® Expected Outcome
When users click "Export JSON Report", a properly formatted JSON file should download with:
- URL of the analyzed page
- Timestamp of analysis
- List of detected third-party domains
- Inline eval patterns
- Summary statistics

## üìù Steps to Complete
1. Review the current export code in `extension/popup.js` (around line 70)
2. Verify all data fields are included
3. Add additional metadata (browser version, extension version, etc.)
4. Ensure proper JSON formatting
5. Test the download functionality
6. Add error handling for edge cases

## üìÇ Files to Modify
- `extension/popup.js` - Export functionality around line 70-85
- `extension/manifest.json` - Verify permissions are correct

- [ ] Filename includes timestamp (e.g., `privacy-report-2025-10-19.json`)
- [ ] Works across different browsers (Chrome, Edge)

## üìä Estimated Difficulty
**Easy** - Perfect for beginners

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Time
About 1-2 hours
